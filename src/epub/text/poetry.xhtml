				<span class="i0">Poor Heart, so weary with thy bitter grief!<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">So thou art dead at last, silent and chill!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The longed-for death-dart came to thy relief,<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">And there thou liest, Heart, forever still.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">Dead eyes, pain-pressed beneath their black-fringed pall!<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">Dead cheeks, dark-furrowed with so many tears!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">So thou art passed far, far beyond recall,<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">And all thy hopes are past, and all thy fears.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">Thy lips are closed at length in the long peace!<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">Pale lips! so long they have thy woe repressed,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">They seem even now when life has run its lease<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">All dumbly pitiful in their mournful rest.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">And now I lay thee in thy silent tomb,<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">Printing thy brow with one last solemn kiss;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Laying upon thee one fair lily bloom,<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">A symbol of thy rest;⁠—oh, rest is bliss.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">No, Heart, I would not call thee back again;<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">No, no; too much of suffering hast thou known;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But yet, but yet, it was not all in vain⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">Thy unseen tears, thy solitary moan!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">For out of sorrow joy comes uppermost;<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">Where breaks the thunder soon the sky smiles blue;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">A better love replaces what is lost,<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">And phantom sunlight pales before the true!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">The seed must burst before the germ unfolds,<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">The stars must fade before the morning wakes;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Down in her depths the mine the diamond holds;<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">A new heart pulses when the old heart breaks.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">And now, Humanity, I turn to you;<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">I consecrate my service to the world!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Perish the old love, welcome to the new⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i2">Broad as the space-aisles where the stars are whirled!<br/></span>

			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">O’er the sweet, quiet homes in the silent grave-city,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Softly the dewdrops, the night-tears, fall;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Broadly about, like the wide arms of pity,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The silver-shot darkness lies over all.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Heroes, asleep ’neath the red-hearted rose-wreaths,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Leaf-crowned with honor, flower-crowned with rest,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Gently above you each moon-dripping bough breathes<br/></span>

		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">We contrast light and darkness,⁠—light of God,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And darkness from the Stygian shades of hell;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Fumes of the pit infernal rising up<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Have clouded o’er the brain, laid reason low;⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For when the eye looks on fair Nature’s face<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And sees not God, then is she blind indeed!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No night so starless, even in its gloom,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">As his who wanders on without a hope<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">In that great, just Hereafter all must meet!⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No heart so dull, so heavy, and so void,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">As that which lives for this chill world alone!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No soul so groveling, unaspiring, base,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">As that which, here, forgets the afterhere!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And still through all the darkness and the gloom<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Its voice will not be stilled, its hopes be quenched;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">It cries, it screams, it struggles in its chains,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And bleeds upon the altar of the mind,⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Unwilling sacrifice to thought misled.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The soul that knows no God can know no peace.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Thus speaketh light, the herald of our God!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">In that far dawn where shone each rolling world<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">First lit with shadowed splendor of the stars,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">In that fair morning when Creation sang<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Its praise of God, e’er yet it dreamed of sin,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Pure and untainted as the source of life<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Man dwelt in Eden. There no shadows came,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No question of the goodness of our Lord,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Until the prince of darkness tempted man,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And, yielding to the newly born desire,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He fell! Sank in the mire of ignorance!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And Man, who put himself in Satan’s power,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Since then has wandered far in devious ways,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Seeing but now and then a glimpse of light,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Till Christ is come, the living Son of God!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Far in his heavenly home he viewed the world,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Saw all her sadness and her sufferings,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Saw all her woes, her struggles, and her search<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For some path leading up from out the Night.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Within his breast the fount of tears was touched;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">His great heart swelled with pity, and he said:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">“Father, I go to save the world from sin.”<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ah! What power but a soul divinely clad<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">In purity, in holiness and love,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Could leave a home of happiness and light<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For this lost World of suffering and death?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He came: the World tossed groaning in her sleep;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He touched her brow: the nightmare passed away;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He soothed her heart, red with the stain of sin;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And she forgot her guilt in penitence;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">She washed the ruby out with pearls of tears.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He came, he suffered, and he died for us;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He felt the bitterest woes a soul can feel;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He probed the darkest depths of human grief;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He sounded all the deeps and shoals of pain;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Was cursed for all his love; thanked with the cross,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Whereon he hung nailed, bleeding, glorified,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">As the last smoke of holocaust divine.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">“Ah! This was all two thousand years ago!”<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Two thousand years ago, and still he cries,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">With voice sweet calling through the distant dark:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">“O souls that labor, struggling in your pain,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Come unto me, and I will give you rest!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For every woe of yours, and every smart,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I, too, have felt:⁠—the mockery, the shame,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The sneer, the scoffing lip, the hate, the lust,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The greed of gain, the jealousy of man,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Unstinted have been measured out to me.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I know them all, I feel them all with you!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And I have known the pangs of poverty,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The cry of hunger and the weary heart<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of childhood burdened with the weight of age!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">O sufferers, ye all are mine to love!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The pulse-beats of my heart go out with you,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And every drop of agony that drips<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">From my nailed hands adown this bitter cross,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Cries out, ‘O God! accept the sacrifice,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And ope the gates of heaven to the world!’<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye vermin of the garret, who do creep<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Your weary lives away within its walls;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye children of the cellar, who behold<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The sweet, pale light, strained through the lothsome air<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And doled to you in tid-bits, as a thing<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Too precious for your use; ye rats in mines,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Who knaw within the black and somber pits<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">To seek poor living for your little ones;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye women who stitch out your lonely lives,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Unmindful whether sun or stars keep watch;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye slaves of wheels; ye worms that bite the dust<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Where pride and scorn have ground you ’neath the heel;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye Toilers of the earth, ye weary ones,⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I know your sufferings, I feel your woes;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">My peace I give you; in a little while<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The pain will all be over, and the grave<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Will sweetly close above your folded hands!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And then?⁠—Ah, Death, no conqueror art thou!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For I have loosed thy chains; I have unbarred<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The gates of heaven! In my Father’s house<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of many mansions I prepare a place;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And rest is there for every heart that toils!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, all ye sick and wounded ones who grieve<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For the lost health that ne’er may come again;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye who do toss upon a couch of pain,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Upon whose brow disease has laid his hand,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Within whose eyes the dull and heavy sight<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Burns like a taper burning very low,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Upon whose lips the purple fever-kiss<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Rests his hot breath, and dries the sickened palms,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Scorches the flesh and e’en the very air;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye who do grope along without the light;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye who do stumble, halting on your way;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye whom the world despises as unclean;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Know that the death-free soul has none of these:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The unbound spirit goes unto its God,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Pure, whole, and beauteous as newly born!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, all ye mourners, weeping for the dead;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Your tears I gather as the grateful rain<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Which rises from the sea and falls again,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">To nurse the withering flowers from its touch;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No drop is ever lost! They fall again<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">To nurse the blossoms of some other heart!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I would not dry one single dew of grief:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The sorrow-freighted lashes which bespeak<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The broken heart and soul are dear to me;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I mourn with them, and mourning so I find<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The grief-bowed soul with weeping oft grows light!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But yet ye mourn for them not without hope:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Beyond the woes and sorrows of the earth,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">As stars still shine though clouds obscure the sight,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The friends ye mourn as lost immortal live;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And ye shall meet and know their souls again,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Through death transfigured, through love glorified!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, all ye patient waiters for reward,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Scorned and despised by those who know not worth,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I know your merit and I give you hope;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For in my Father’s law is justice found.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">See how the seed-germ, toiling underground,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Waits patiently for time to burst its shell;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And by and by the golden sunlight warms<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The dark, cold earth; the germ begins to shoot.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And upward trends until two small green leaves<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Unfold and wave and drink the pure, fresh air.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The blossoms come and go with Summer’s breath,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And Autumn brings the fruit-time in her hand.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">So ye, who patient watch and wait and hope,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Trusting the sun may bring the blossoms out,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Shall reap the fruited labor by and by.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I am your friend; I wait and hope with you,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Rejoice with you when the hard vict’ry’s won!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And still for you, O prisoners in cells,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I hold the dearest gifts of penitence,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Forgiveness and charity and hope!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I stretch the hands of mercy through the bars;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">White hands,⁠—like doves they bring the branch of peace!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Repent, believe,⁠—and I will expiate<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Upon this bitter cross all your deep guilt!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, take my gift, accept my sacrifice!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I ask no other thing but only⁠—trust!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, all ye martyrs, bleeding in your chains;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, all ye souls that live for others’ good;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, all ye mourners, all ye guilty ones,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And all ye suffering ones, come unto me!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye are all my brothers, all my sisters, all!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And as I love one, so I love you all.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Accept my love, accept my sacrifice;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Make not my cross more bitter than it is<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">By shrinking from the peace I bring to you!”<br/></span>

			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">Grand eye of Liberty, light up my page!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Like promised morning after night of age<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Thy dawning youth breaks in the distant east!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Thy cloudy robes like silken curtains creased<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And swung in folds are floating fair and free!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The shadows of the cycles turn and flee;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The budding stars, bright minds that gemmed the night,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Are bursting into broad, bright-petaled light!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Sweet Liberty, how pure thy very breath!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">How dear in life, how doubly dear in death!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ah, slaves that suffer in your self-forged chains,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Praying your Christ to touch and heal your pains,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Tear off your shackling irons, unbind your eyes,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Seize the grand hopes that burn along the skies!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Worship not God in temples built of gloom;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Far sweeter incense is the flower-bloom<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Than all the fires that Sacrifice may light;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And grander is the star-dome gleaming bright<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">With glowing worlds, than all your altar lamps<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Pale flickering in your clammy, vaulted damps;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And richer is the broad, full, fair sun sheen,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Dripping its orient light in streams between<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The fretted shafting of the forest trees,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Throwing its golden kisses to the breeze,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Lifting the grasses with its finger-tips,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And pressing the young blossoms with warm lips,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Show’ring its glory over plain and hill,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Wreathing the storm and dancing in the rill;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Far richer in wild freedom falling there,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Shaking the tresses of its yellow hair,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Than all subdued within the dim half-light<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of stained glass windows, drooping into night.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Oh, grander far the massive mountain walls<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Which bound the vista of the forest halls,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Than all the sculptured forms which guard the piles<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">That arch your tall, dim, gray, cathedral aisles!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And gladder is the carol of a bird<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Than all the anthems that were ever heard<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">To steal in somber chanting from the tone<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of master voices praising the Unknown.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">In the great wild, where foot of man ne’er trod,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">There find we Nature’s church and Nature’s God!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Here are no fetters! though is free as air;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Its flight may spread far as its wings may dare;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And through it all one voice cries, “God is love,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And love is God!” Around, within, above,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Behold the working of the perfect law,⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The law immutable in which no flaw<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Exists, and from which no appeal is made;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ev’n as the sunlight chases far the shade<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And shadows chase the light in turn again,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">So every life is fraught with joy and pain;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The stinging thorn lies hid beside the rose;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The bud is blighted ere its leave unclose;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">So pleasure born of Hope may oft-time yield<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">A stinging smart of thorns, a barren field!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But let it be: the buds will bloom again,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The fields will freshen in the summer rain;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And never storm scowls dark but still, somewhere,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">A bow is bending in the upper air.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Then learn the law if thou wouldst live aright;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And know no unseen power, no hand of might,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Can set aside the law which wheels the stars;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No incompleteness its perfection mars;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The buds will wake in season, and the rain<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">will fall when clouds hang heavy, and again<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The snows will tremble when the winter’s breath<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Congeals the cloud-tears, as the touch of Death<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Congeals the last drop on the sufferer’s cheek.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Thus do all Nature’s tongues in chorus speak:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">“Think not, O man, that thou canst e’er escape<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">One jot of Justice’s law, nor turn thy fate<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">By yielding sacrifice to the Unseen!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Purged by thyself alone canst thou be clean.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">One guide to happiness thou mayst learn:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">
					<i>Love toward the world begets love in return.</i>
					<br/>
				</span>
				<span class="i0">And if to others you the measure mete<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of love, be sure your harvest will be sweet;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But if ye sow broadcast the seed of hate,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye’ll reap again, albeit ye reap it late.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Then let your life-work swell the great flood-tide<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of love towards all the world; the world is wide,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The sea of life is broad; its waves stretch far;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No range, no barrier, its sweep may bar;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The world is filled, is trodden down with pain;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The sea of life is gathered up of rain,⁠—<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">A throat, a bed, a sink, for human tears,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">A burial of hopes, a miasm of fears!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But see! the sun of love shines softly out,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Flinging its golden fingers all about,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Pressing its lips in loving, soft caress,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Upon the world’s pale cheek; the pain grows less,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The tears are dried upon the quivering lashes,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">An answering sunbeam ’neath the white lids flashes!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The sea of life is dimpled o’er with smiles,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The sun of love the cloud of woe beguiles,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And turns its heavy brow to forehead fair,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Framed in the glory of its sun-gilt hair.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Be thine the warming touch, the kiss of love;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Vainly ye seek for comfort from above,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Vainly ye pray the Gods to ease your pain;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The heavy words fall back on you again!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Vainly ye cry for Christ to smooth your way;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The thorns sting sharper while ye kneeling pray!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Vainly ye look upon the world of woe,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And cry, “O God, avert the bitter blow!”<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye cannot turn the lightning from its track,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Nor call one single little instant back;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The law swerves not, and with unerring aim<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The shaft of justice falls; he bears the blame<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Who violates the rule: do well your task,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">For justice overtakes you all at last.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Vainly ye patient ones await reward,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Trusting th’ Almighty’s angel to record<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Each bitter tear, each disappointed sigh;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Reward descends not, gifted from on high,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But is the outgrowth of the eternal law:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">As from the earth the toiling seed-germs draw<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The food which gives them life and strength to bear<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The storms and suns which sweep the upper air,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">So ye must draw from out the pregnant earth<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The metal true wherewith to build your worth;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">So shall ye brave the howling of the blast,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And smile triumphant o’er the storm at last.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Nor dream these trials are without their use;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Between your joys and griefs ye cannot choose,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And say your life with either is complete:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ever the bitter mingles with the sweet.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The dews must press the petals down at night,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If in the dawning they would glisten bright;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If sunbeams needs must ripen out the grain<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Not less the early blades must woo the rain:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If now your eyes be wet with weary tears,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye’ll gather them as gems in after years;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And if the rains now sodden down your path,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye’ll reap rich harvest in the aftermath.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Ye idle mourners, crying in your grief,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The souls ye weep have found the long relief:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Why grieve for those who fold their hands in peace?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Their sore-tried hearts have found a glad release;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Their spirits sink into the solemn sea!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Mourn ye the prisoner from his chains let free?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Nay, ope your ears unto the living cry<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">That pleads for living comfort! Hark, the sigh<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of million heartaches rising in your ears!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Kiss back the living woes, the living tears!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Go down into the felon’s gloomy cell;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Send there the ray of love: as tree-buds swell<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">When spring’s warm breath bids the cold winter cease,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">So will his heart swell with the hope of peace.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Be filled with love, for love is Nature’s God;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The God which trembles in the tender sod,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The God which tints the sunset, lights the dew,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Sprinkles with stars the firmament’s broad blue,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And draws all hearts together in a free<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Wide sweep of love, broad as the ether-sea.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No other law or guidance do we need;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The world’s our church, to do good is our creed.<br/></span>

				<span class="i0">So, you’re the chaplain! You needn’t say what you have come for; I can guess.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You’ve come to talk about Jesus’ love, and repentance and rest and forgiveness!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You’ve come to say that my sin is great, yet greater the mercy Heaven will mete,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If I, like Magdalen, bend my head, and pour my tears at your Saviour’s feet.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Your promise is fair, but I’ve little faith: I relied on promises once before;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">They brought me to this⁠—this prison cell, with its iron-barred window, its grated door!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Yet he, too, was fair who promised me, with his tender mouth and his Christ-like eyes;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And his voice was as sweet as the summer wind that sighs through the arbors of Paradise.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And he seemed to me all that was good and pure, and noble and strong, and true and brave!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I had given the pulse of my heart for him, and deemed it a precious boon to crave.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">You say that Jesus so loved the world he died to redeem it from its sin:<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">It isn’t redeemed, or no one could be so fair without, and so black within.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I trusted his promise, I gave my life;⁠—the truth of my love is known on high,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If there is a God who knows all things;⁠—his promise was false, his <i>love</i> was a lie!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">It was over soon, Oh! soon, the dream,⁠—and me, he had called “his life,” “his light,”<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He drove me away with a sneering word, and you Christians said that “it served me right.”<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I was proud, Mr. Chaplain, even then; I set my face in the teeth of Fate,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And resolved to live honestly, come what might, and sink beneath neither scorn nor hate.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Yes, and I prayed that the Christ above would help to bear the bitter cross,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And put something here, where my heart had been, to fill up the aching void of loss.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">It’s easy for you to say what I should do, but none of you ever dream how hard<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Is the way that you Christians make for us, with your “sin no more,” “trust the Lord.”<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">When for days and days you are turned from work with cold politeness, or open sneer,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You get so you don’t trust a far-off God, whose creatures are cold, and they, so near.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You hold your virtuous lives aloof, and refuse us your human help and hand,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And set us apart as accursèd things, marked with a burning, Cain-like brand.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">But I didn’t bend, though many days I was weary and hungry, and worn and weak,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And for many a starless night I watched, through tears that grooved down my pallid cheek.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">They are all dry now! They say I’m hard, because I never weep or moan!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You can’t draw blood when the heart’s bled out! you can’t find tears or sound in a stone!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And I don’t know why <i>I</i> should be mild and meek: no one has been very mild to me.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You say that Jesus would be⁠—perhaps! but Heaven’s a long way off, you see.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">That will do; I know what you’re going to say: “I can have it right here in this narrow cell.”<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The <i>soul</i> is slow to accept Christ’s heav’n when his followers chain the body in hell.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Not but I’m just as well off here,⁠—better, perhaps, than I was outside.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The world was a prison-house to me, where I dwelt, defying and defied.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">I don’t know but I’d think more of what you say, if they’d given us both a common lot;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If justice to me had been justice to him, and covered our names with an equal blot;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But they took him into the social court, and pitied, and said he’d been “led astray”;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">In a month the stain on <i>his</i> name had passed, as a cloud that crosses the face of day!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">He joined the Church, and he’s preaching now, just as you are, the love of God,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And the duty of sinners to kneel and pray, and humbly to kiss the chastening rod.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If they’d dealt with me as they dealt by him, may be I’d credit your Christian love;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If they’d dealt with him as they dealt by me, I’d have more faith in a just Above.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">I don’t know, but sometimes I used to think that she, who was told there was no room<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">In the inn at Bethlehem, might look down with softened eyes thro’ the starless gloom.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Christ wasn’t a woman⁠—he couldn’t know the pain and endurance of it; but <i>she</i>,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">The mother who bore him, she might know, and Mary in Heaven might pity me.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Still that was useless: it didn’t bring a single mouthful for me to eat,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Nor work to get it, nor sheltering from the dreary wind and the howling street.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Heavenly pity won’t pass as coin, and earthly shame brings a higher pay.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Sometimes I was tempted to give it up, and go, like others, the easier way;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But I didn’t; no, sir, I kept my oath, though my baby lay in my arms and cried,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And at last, to spare it⁠—I poisoned it; and kissed its murdered lips when it died.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I’d never seen him since it was born (he’d said that it wasn’t his, you know);<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">But I took its body and laid it down at the steps of his door, in the pallid glow<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Of the winter morning; and when he came, with a love-tune hummed on those lips of lies,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">It lay at his feet, with its pinched white face staring up at him from its dead, blue eyes;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I hadn’t closed them; they were like his, and so was the mouth and the curled gold hair,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And every feature so like his own,⁠—for I am dark, sir, and he is fair.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">‘ ’Twas a moment of triumph, that showed me yet there was a passion I could feel,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">When I saw him bend o’er its meagre form, and, starting backwards, cry out and reel!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">If there <i>is</i> a time when all souls shall meet the reward of the deeds that are done in the clay,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">When accused and accuser stand face to face, he will cry out so in the Judgment Day!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">The rest? Oh, nothing. They hunted me, and with virtuous lawyers’ virtuous tears<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">To a virtuous jury, convicted me; and I’m sentenced to stay here for twenty years.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Do I repent? Yes, I do; but wait till I tell you of what I repent, and why.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I repent that I ever believed a man could be anything but a living lie!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I repent because every noble thought, or hope, or ambition, or earthly trust,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Is as dead as dungeon-bleached bones in me,⁠—as dead as my child in its murdered dust!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Do I repent that I killed the babe? Am I repentant for that, you ask?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I’ll answer the truth as I feel it, sir; I leave to others the pious mask.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Am I repentant because I saved its starving body from Famine’s teeth?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Because I hastened what time would do, to spare it pain and relieve its death?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Am I repentant because I held it were better a <i>grave</i> should have no name<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Than a <i>living being</i>, whose only care must come from a mother weighed with shame?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Am I repentant because I thought it were better the tiny form lay hid<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">From the heartless stings of a brutal world, unknown, unnamed, ’neath a coffin lid?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Am I repentant for the act, the last on earth in my power, to save<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">From the long-drawn misery of life, in the early death and the painless grave?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">I’m <i>glad</i> that I did it! Start if you will! I’ll repeat it over; I say I’m <i>glad</i>!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">No, I’m neither a fiend, nor a maniac⁠—don’t look as if I were going mad!<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">Did I not love it? Yes, I loved with a strength that you, sir, can never feel;<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">It’s only a strong love can kill to save, tho’ itself be torn where time cannot heal.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You see my hands⁠—they are red with its blood! Yet I would have cut them, bit by bit,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And fed them, and smiled to see it eat, if that would have saved and nourished it!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">“Beg!” I <i>did</i> beg,⁠—and “pray!” I <i>did</i> pray! God was as stony and hard as Earth,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And Christ was as deaf as the stars that watched, or the night that darkened above his birth!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And I⁠—I feel stony now, too, like them; deaf to sorrow and mute to grief!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Am I heartless?⁠—yes:⁠—it-is-<i>all</i>-<span class="smcap">cut</span>-OUT! Torn! Gone! All gone! Like my dead belief.<br/></span>
			</div>
			<div class="stanza">
				<span class="i0">Do I not fear for the judgment hour? So unrepentant, so hard and cold?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Wait! It is little I trust in that; but if ever the scrolled sky shall be uprolled,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And the lives of men shall be read and known, and their acts be judged by their very worth,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And the Christ you speak of shall come again, and the thunders of Justice shake the earth,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">You will hear the cry, “Who murdered here? Come forth to the judgment, false heart and eyes,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">That pulsed with accurséd strength of lust, and loaded faith with envenomed lies!<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Come forth to the judgment, haughty dames, who scathed the mother with your scorn,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And answer here, to the poisoned child, <i>who</i> decreed its murder ere it was born?<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Come forth to the judgment ye who heaped the gold of earth in your treasured hoard,<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">And answer, ‘guilty,’ to those who stood all naked and starving, beneath your board.<br/></span>
				<span class="i0">Depart, accurséd! I know you not! Ye heeded not the command of Heaven,<br/></span>

				<span class="i0">But, no⁠—it’s not that; that will never be! I trusted too long, and He answered not.<br/></span>
